This workshop only has time to cover the basics of deploying applications to OpenShift. If you'd like to explore more on your own, here are some additional tools and resources:

## Nodeshift
Nodeshift is an opinionated command line application and programmable API that you can use to deploy Node.js projects to OpenShift.

[More Info on Nodeshift](https://nodeshift.dev)

## OpenShift Do (odo)
odo is a fast, iterative, and straightforward CLI tool for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on OpenShift.

Existing tools such as oc are more operations-focused and require a deep-understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. odo abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts for the developer, thus allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: code.

## CodeReady Containers - OpenShift on Your Laptop
Install OpenShift locally on your laptop to make development easier.

## Interactive Tutorials
For interactive tutorials on many different aspects of OpenShift and developing applications for OpenShift, visit [learn.openshift.com](https://learn.openshift.com). These tutorials are always available.

## Come by the Red Hat booth!
We'll be at the Red Hat booth for the rest of the conference. Come by with any follow-up questions or to try out some of the interactive tutorials yourself.
